Install Docker or Docker Toolbox




Below are the different actions that can be performed in docker compose, most must clone the git repo first since they need the source code. The only one that doesn't need the source code is the last which can be run in an empty directory.

## To start development from source (must clone)

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml -f docker-compose-ports.yml -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build
    
Then Goto the web browser and access localhost:4201


## Start production from source (must clone)

    docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml -f docker-compose-ports.yml -f docker-compose-prod.yml up --build

Then Goto the web browser and access localhost:4201

## Build production from source and push image to docker-hub (must clone)

- build images in prod mode: 

      docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml -f docker-compose-prod.yml -f docker-compose-images.yml build

- Login: 
        
      docker login

- Push the built images to docker-hub 

      docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml -f docker-compose-images.yml push

Then view pushed images:

- https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/arkareem/pdf-mobile-integration-frontend

- https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/arkareem/pdf-mobile-integration-backend


## Start production from image (no clone needed)
- Get the latest docker compose yml files
        
      curl -o docker-compose-images.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ar-Kareem/pdf-mobile-integration/master/docker-compose-images.yml
      curl -o docker-compose-ports.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ar-Kareem/pdf-mobile-integration/master/docker-compose-ports.yml
      curl -o docker-compose-watchtower.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ar-Kareem/pdf-mobile-integration/master/docker-compose-watchtower.yml

- Pull the images from the cloud: 
        
      docker-compose -f docker-compose-images.yml pull

- Finally, Open the ports, run the images, and continuously watch for changes:

      docker-compose -f docker-compose-ports.yml -f docker-compose-images.yml -f docker-compose-watchtower.yml up

- Or with a single command that will also take care of all the above 

      curl -o docker-compose-images.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ar-Kareem/pdf-mobile-integration/master/docker-compose-images.yml && curl -o docker-compose-ports.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ar-Kareem/pdf-mobile-integration/master/docker-compose-ports.yml && curl -o docker-compose-watchtower.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ar-Kareem/pdf-mobile-integration/master/docker-compose-watchtower.yml && docker-compose -f docker-compose-images.yml pull && docker-compose -f docker-compose-ports.yml -f docker-compose-images.yml -f docker-compose-watchtower.yml up

the above command can be run in an empty directory in erither linux or windows<sup>[1]</sup> and will take care of all needed components to start the production server<sup>[2]</sup>

[1] Only works in CMD for windows not Powershell, because powershell does not support `&&`

[2] all needed components except for needing docker installed of course

To see the webapp in action, go to the web browser and access {SERVER_URL}:4201


# View and Prune local images

If you run too many build commands, you can run `docker image ls` to see how many images you have.
If you want to prune images then run `docker image prune`
